description: Standards for following CLEAN architecture
globs: *.cs
---
- organize code into layers: Domain (entities/value objects), Application (use cases/services), Infrastructure (data access/external APIs), Presentation (controllers)
- dependencies flow inward: outer layers depend on inner layers, never the reverse
- domain layer has no external dependencies - only pure C# types
- define interfaces in inner layers, implement in outer layers
- controllers should only orchestrate - delegate business logic to services
- services contain business logic and coordinate domain entities
- keep entities behavior-rich, avoid anemic domain models
- use DTOs at layer boundaries to prevent leaking internal structures
- infrastructure concerns (database, HTTP, files) stay in Infrastructure layer
- inject dependencies via constructor - no service locator patterns
- one use case per service method - avoid god services
