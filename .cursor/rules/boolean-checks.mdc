- avoid intermediate variables for simple boolean conditions
- prefer inline truthiness checks like `!!array.length` over `array.length > 0`
- use optional chaining with double-bang for nullable arrays: `!!entity?.items.length`
- keep boolean derivations inline in JSX conditions when they are simple one-liners
